# Clojure Everywhere

This tutorial explores the use of Clojure throughout the web application stack. We start by building a client-only application in [Clojure in the client](https://github.com/subhash/clj-stack/wiki/Clojure-in-the-client) and then move the data model to the server in [Clojure in the server](https://github.com/subhash/clj-stack/wiki/Clojure-in-the-server). Finally, we finish up with a persisted database in [Clojure in the database](https://github.com/subhash/clj-stack/wiki/Clojure-in-the-Database). As an addendum, [Datomic from the ground up](https://github.com/subhash/clj-stack/wiki/Datomic-from-the-ground-up) introduces basic concepts of Datomic. Through the tutorial, we become familiar with various frameworks and technologies like Om, Pedestal and of course, Datomic

## Prerequisites

We assume a working knowledge of Clojure. Though not necessary, a basic understanding of ReactJS (especially it's approach to a Virtual DOM) will be useful. 

## Intended audience

This tutorial is basically a consolidated form of information found in various tutorials and guides. The added perspective is how the various frameworks work together. The target audience is someone in between n00b and Nolen.
