# Clojure Everywhere

This tutorial explores the use of Clojure throughout the web application stack. We start by building a client-only application in [[Clojure in the client]] and then move the data model to the server in [[Clojure in the server]]. Finally, we finish up with a persisted database in [[Clojure in the database]]. As an addendum, [[Datomic from the ground up]] introduces basic concepts of Datomic. Through the tutorial, we become familiar with various frameworks and technologies like Om, Pedestal and of course, Datomic

## Prerequisites

We assume a working knowledge of Clojure. Though not necessary, a basic understanding of ReactJS (especially it's approach to a Virtual DOM) will be useful. 

## Intended audience

This tutorial is basically a consolidated form of information found in various tutorials and guides. The added perspective is how the various frameworks work together. The target audience is someone in between n00b and Nolen.
